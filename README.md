    abstract = {This study investigates Whisper's ASR system performance across diverse native and non-native English accents. Results reveal superior recognition in American compared to British and Australian English accents, with similar performance in Canadian English. Overall, native English accents demonstrate higher accuracy than non-native ones. Exploring connections between speaker traits (sex, L1 typology, and L2 proficiency) and word error rate uncovers notable associations. Furthermore, Whisper exhibits enhanced performance in read speech over conversational speech, with modifications based on speaker gender. The implications of these findings are discussed.}
